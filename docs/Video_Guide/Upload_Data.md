In order to upload imaging data to XNAT you must log in with your credentials. Now you can upload a DICOM.zip to the ‘prearchive’ as explained in the following steps.

By clicking the XNAT icon in the top left corner the website provides you with an overview of your projects and the most recent data activity.

To create a new project navigate to the header and click NEW > PROJECT and give it a title, running title, project ID. Here you can also provide further information, such as keyword. Lastly, define if the project is private, protected, or public and click CREATE.

Clicking the XNAT icon once more shows the newly created project in the project section.
In order to upload subject data click UPLOAD > IMAGES > COMPRESSED UPLOADER. Proceed by selecting your project and choosing a destination. By clicking PREARCHIVE the data will temporarily be stored in a medium where you can control and change subject information before forwarding them to the archive. Now you can choose the data to be uploaded. Attention: Data has to be stored in a zip. file. Click BEGIN UPLOAD to upload the imaging data to the prearchive.

Now you can proceed to the prearchive by navigating to UPLOAD > PREARCHIVE. The data of the newly added subject can now be reviewed and archived. In order to do so click on REVIEW AND ARCHIVE. Pick a subject ID by clicking ADD NEW SUBJECT and provide any other necessary demographical information. By proceeding with SUBMIT you have successfully uploaded one subject scan to the archive.

By clicking MANAGE FILES you can view the DICOMS of the scan. By clicking VIEW IMAGES, XNAT provides you with a preliminary graphical representation of your imaging data (DICOMS).
