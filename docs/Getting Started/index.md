## First steps for new students

To get this, Please send (valentin.riedl@tum.de) email with following infos: 
``Name``:  
``birth date``: 
``phone``:  
``private email``: 
This step will enable you to get access code for your @tum-email. As soon as you get the email address login at `www.mail.tum.de` and do the following:
- Register with your @tum-email account for a MS OneDrive account at ([website](https://www/microsoft.com/de-de/education/products/office))

2. **Medical Checkup**.
